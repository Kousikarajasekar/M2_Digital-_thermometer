When the power is given to the circuit the LM35 sensor displays the name and temperature and the temperature varies with respect to the voltage range. 
The Atmega 328p microcontroller is responsible to fetch the data from lm35 sensor and sends to the lcd display. 
partial output of the project is derived.
